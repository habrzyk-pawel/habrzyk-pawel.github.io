The newest member of <shiny new thing>Ops family of names is MLOps. Like with every other position name in software engineering, the name does not correspond to **actual** actions performed by theese specialists, but to the **purpose** of those actions. This article is an attempt at claryfying *why* companies need to MLOps.

## Prediction quality > other KPI's

More often than not, software is used to answear a "what is going to hapen next" based on the histry collected so far. That might be predicting the next tsunami, recession, word or body movement. A logical consequence of our deep care for prediction quality is that we want the process to be as scientific and standarized as possible. We want to reduce human error, isolate variables that influence performance, have control groups, a full package. 

## Software vs. AI

In conventional software, the reaction of a program to external information is described in code. When we modify code, we have a good intuition how that change is going to affect the entire system. On the other hand, in Ai systems the reaction of the program to external information is described in data. That has quite profound consequences, as it shifts attention from writing code to collecting as much data as possible and definining goals, while program logic is generated by a specific algorithm. We then compare the results of that generation, that were trained under slightly different starting conditions.

## MLOps is DevOps coulture in Ai and Big Data

Long ago, software had a release cycle of hardware products. Requirements collection, architecture design, coding, testing, defect correction and release. From an outside perspective, release looked like throwing a ready made solutions through a fence, and hoping there is someone else on the other side to catch it and care for it. That someone else were admins, who were responsible for somehow makeing the program they've never seen work. DevOps is shifting that reponsibility onto people that wrote the damn app. Developers did what developers do and automated the hell out of the processes necessary to keep the app running. The Ai world is in a similar place - data scientists build some binary file and send it over to developers, who are responsible for ensuring the model is running correctly, despite not knowing what that actually means. The responsibility to ensure the (and ability to react to unsatisfactory) model performance should be as much in the hands of a data scientist as possible. MLOps is really automations that enable the data scientists to do just that. It comes with several challanges, four of which we will discuss further
